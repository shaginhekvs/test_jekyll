  text: 'In 1992, four LA police officers were videotaped beating a black man named Rodney King. Their later acquittal instigated riots, lootings, arsons, and civil disturbances in what is now known as the 1992 Rodney King riots, but these events did not result in a social movement . However, in summer 2013, the death of Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of his killer provoked the birth of Black Lives Matter, a protest that spread throughout all US and is known all over  the world. What made the difference between the two events? Social media. Black Lives Matter supposed the consolidation of a new form of protest: Hashtag activism.'

This project analyzes the coverage of social movements in Twitter. Twitter allows one to connect with people from all over the world in a short amount of time, creating new ways to participate and support social movement. News appear on twitter before they do in traditional medias like newspapers and the impact and importance of any statement is now measured in how many people retweet it. We study how users see, share and discuss these protests and movements and analyze different trends in three protests:

* Black Lives Matter:  The protest that started it all, calling for an end to police brutality and the racism in the U.S against black people.
* Trump: Since the day Trump became president of the United States, a protest under the flag #Resist, rose, facing the many of Trump supporters behind the hashtag #MAGA.
* Misogyny: One of the most active movements today and not just a single protest, but an accumulation of them, all calling for a stop in the harassment, rape and violence towards women.
